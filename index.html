                    <P>Lover is the seventh studio album of the american pop singer Taylor Swift. The announcement came right after the release of its lead-single, ME!. 
                        The album also already produced the single "You Need to Calm Down", which has a message of support to LGBT community and went viral after showing the 
                        conciliation with Katy Perry on the music video.

                    <p>After an intense backlash in 2017, Katy Perry made her amazing comeback in 2019 with her already Platinum single Never Really Over. 
                        Now, she's ready to continue the new era in her career with the single "Small Talk", produced by the pop star Charlie Puth.

                    <p>After her last and successful album, Lust for Life, which was responsible to introduce a new side of Lana, it's time to get ready for her new 
                        album: Norman Fuc*ing Rockwell. The work towards the album started earlier this year, with the release of the singles Venice Beach and Mariners Complex 
                        Apartment. And she didn't stop there. Before the album's announcement, Lana also released two other singles: "Hope is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman Like Me 
                        to Have" and "Doin' Time".
